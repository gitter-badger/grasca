# grasca 

/ɡraˈʒka/ - **Gra**phite client in **Sca**la (yet only metrics reader) 

### Motivation
Lack of easy to use Scala library, that allows to read metrics from Graphite server.
 
### API
Library accesses Graphite API described here: [http://graphite-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html]

### to-do:
* cover with tests
* integrate library, which allows to write to graphite
* create some visualization software
* create simple anomaly detection
* create cross-metric comparator
